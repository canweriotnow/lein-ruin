A Leiningen plugin to ruin your project, and your day.

Inspired by my tendency to mistype =lein run= as =lein ruin=

** Usage

Put =[lein-ruin "0.1.1"]= into the =:plugins= vector of your
=:user= profile.

or, for a single project:

Put =[lein-ruin "0.1.1"]= into the =:plugins= vector of your
project.clj.


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ lein ruin
#+END_EXAMPLE

lein-ruin will scrub all parentheses and brackets from your source files,
ruining everything. And commit the changes so you're extra screwed.
